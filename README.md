Copter Controller

## Key mapping

key mappings are currently hardcoded. I'd like to make them setting based but for now they're defined within the state of the Controller Component.

Mappings are as follows:

Key | function
--- | ---
a | Yaw left
d | Yaw right
w | pitch forward
s | pitch backwards
e | nudge throttle up
f | nudge throttle down
ArrowUp | increase throttle
ArrowDown | decrease throttle
ArrowLeft | rotate clockwise
ArrowRight | rotate anti-clockwise
